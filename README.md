Application to create a LoRaWAN connected object with multiple IO lines that can be controlled from the backend.
It uses the wyres w_proto card BSP (by default), and the wyres generic utility library as a base.
It uses the wyres app-core generic state machine, with specific module in this project to handle generic GPIO lines (mod-io).

See the readme in the app directory for details on building targets for specific IO cabling.
